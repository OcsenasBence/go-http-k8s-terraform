## 🧩 Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed locally:

- **Go** — to run the HTTP server locally  
- **Docker** — for containerization  
- **Minikube** — to run a local Kubernetes cluster  
- **kubectl** — to interact with Kubernetes  
- **Terraform** — to manage Kubernetes resources declaratively  

---

## ⚙️ Application Components

### 1. Application Files
Located inside the project root:

- `main.go` — A simple Go HTTP server that listens on port `8080` and returns `"Hello, World!"`  
- `Dockerfile` — Defines how to build the Docker image used by both the CI pipeline and Kubernetes  

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
Located inside the `.github/workflows` folder:

- `docker-publish.yml` — A GitHub Actions workflow that builds and pushes the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) whenever code is pushed to the repository.  

### 3. Kubernetes Manifests
Located inside the `k8s/` folder:

- `deployment.yaml` — Defines the Kubernetes Deployment with two replicas of the Go HTTP server  
- `service.yaml` — Exposes the Deployment internally using a ClusterIP service on port `8080`  

### 4. Terraform Configuration
Located inside the `terraform/` folder:

- `main.tf` — Defines Kubernetes resources as Terraform manifests  
- `provider.tf` — Configures the Kubernetes provider using your kubeconfig context (e.g. `minikube`)  
- `variables.tf` — Sets the container image variable for the deployment

## 🚀 Setting up the Application

### 1. Start Minikube Cluster
The application runs inside a local Minikube cluster.  
Start Minikube using:

```bash
minikube start
2. Deploy with Kubernetes YAML
If you prefer to apply the Kubernetes manifests directly:

bash

kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
Check the resources:

bash

kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
3. Deploy with Terraform
Alternatively, deploy the same resources via Terraform:

bash

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
Terraform will read your Kubernetes context (e.g. minikube) and create the Deployment and Service automatically.

🌍 Using the Application
Once deployed, forward the service port to access the app locally:

bash

kubectl port-forward deployment/go-http 8080:8080
Then open http://localhost:8080
You should see:


Hello, World!
🧹 Cleaning up Resources
To delete all resources and stop the Minikube cluster:

bash

minikube delete
This removes the Kubernetes cluster, all deployments, and services.
